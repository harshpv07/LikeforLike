                  <h5>Improve your Google Plus marketing!                  </h5>
                  <p>Google+ is a social networking and identity service that is owned and operated by Google Inc. Google has described Google+ as a "social layer" that enhances many of its online properties, and that it is not simply a social networking website, but also an authorship tool that associates web-content directly with its owner/author. It is the second-largest social networking site in the world after Facebook. 540 million monthly active users are part of the Identity service site, by interacting socially with Google+'s enhanced properties, like Gmail, +1 button, and YouTube comments.                  </p>
                  <h5>Has your business set up a Google+ page?                  </h5>                  
                  <p>These few tips will help you to increase your chances of getting seen on Google+, and more importantly, help Google drive traffic to your page.                  </p>
                  <p>Fill out page</p>
                  <p>As you're setting up your business page, focus on using keywords as you fill out the Introduction in your Google+ page's About section. Use both the keywords you want to rank high on and the keywords your customers are using. And as you fill out this section, be sure to think about what would be attractive to your customers.                  </p>
                    <p>Add Links Throughout Your Page                  </p>
                    <p>Google+ business pages allow you to add links in lots of different places. Take advantage of it! You are able to create links in the Introduction section.                  </p>
                  <p>Make Use of the Hover Text                  </p>
                  <p>As with setting up personal Google+ profiles, you can influence what people see when they mouse over your business name in Google+. They might do this when searching on a topic or simply responding to a post..                  </p>
                  <p>Promote Your Business Page Everywhere using Like4Like.org!!!                  </p>
                  <p>One of the best ways to get people to follow your Google+ business page is to let them know you have one! In addition to putting the link in your email footer and on all of your other social media pages, you can add a badge to your site.

                    Google+ offers a way to make a badge. But a prettier way to make a badge is to use a site like Widgets Plus. This option allows for an impressive amount of customization.
                    
                    Including an interactive badge helps people circle you while on your site. They do not have to go to Google+ to do it. As soon as they circle you, they will be able to see your updates in their news feed.
                    
                    Getting people to circle you is crucial. Being in more people's circles, or having more Google+ followers, improves your position on regular Google searches. Exchange is free, fast and easy with our "Google Plus On The Page" system... :)
                    
                    And at this point, businesses can not circle people until people have circled them first! You will want to be aggressive in telling people about your Google+ page so you will be able to share with them too.</p>
                    <p>Get Your Employees on Google+                    </p>
                    <p>Encourage your employees to set up personal Google+ profiles. You can not tell them how to use those profiles. But you can ask that they add your website as a link in their Links section. You should also ask them to share your business page and its posts with their friends.                    </p>
                    <p>Steps 1-5 set the foundation for Google+ dominance. But only interesting posts will keep you there. Unfortunately, interesting is defined by your customers. Here are some tips to make your posts interesting</p>
                    <ul>
                      <li>Experiment across platforms. Try posting the same updates on Facebook and Google+ and see where you get the better response. You will be surprised at how the followers interact differently.                      </li>
                      <li>Try posting your blog in Google+.If you already have a blog, rather than simply posting a link to it in Google+, try posting the text and the link in an update. Posts that take up more of someone's news feed seem to gain more traction than the Twitter-like 140-character updates.                      </li>
                      <li>Be quirky. Google+ users are very interested in sharing and commenting on quirky posts. So if there is any way for your business to do something quirky, it will help people become interested in you.</li>
                      <li>Use pictures and video. Pictures and video work incredibly well on Google+. People are far more interested in sharing images then straight text posts   </li>
                    </ul>
                    <br>
                    <p>It doesn't matter whether you are a beer and wine blogger, a global business, a consultant or a hobbyist collector you cannot ignore 'Google Search'. Since the launch of Google, our lives have been transformed with increasingly relevant information available at our fingertips.

                      Make sure you investigate what Google SEO Tools are available to help with your SEO. So here are a range of things you can do using Google's tools that will help with SEO.</p>
                    <h5>The ways that Google Plus will improve your SEO:                    </h5>
                    <p>Google Plus content is treated by Google just like any other page on the web. Google Plus content will be efficiently indexed by Google, it will gain page rank and appear in Google's search results. With two thirds of searches in the US taking place on Google you want your content indexed and searchable in this way.</p>
                    <p>Google Plus posts allow you to capture SERP real estate as they appear on Google search page results, thus your audience may find your Google Plus content through a standard Google search.</p>  
                    <p>Google Plus content stays around, gains page rank, gives page rank and appears in search results over a long time period. It appears Google Plus posts can retain ranking indefinitely with some posts over a year old still top of search result pages. Compare this to the 14 minutes of life a standard tweet is estimated to have.                    </p>
                    <p>Google Plus authorship provides you with a higher visual profile in search results. By validating your Google Plus profile with sites where you publish, you will enable your image to appear next to the search results and attract greater visual attention on search pages.</p>
                    <p>The use of Google authorship is closely tied to content authority. Google is keen to give a higher profile to authoritative content in search results. If an author posts interesting content which is shared and receives plus ones, this will potentially lead to higher authority. There is growing evidence that Google+ authorship improves your authority and search performance.                    </p>
                    <p>Google Plus authorship and the Google Plus social layer provides a wide range of social signals that may improve the Social Media Optimization (SMO) of your content and SEO. This is not as simple as the number of followers, people in your circles or number of Plus Ones. What appears to be far more important is the interaction between you and your content and others of a high authority. Thus if a high authority person shares your content this will improve your own authority.                    </p>
                    <p>Social signals from platforms such as Google Plus will become more important in determining search results.                    </p>
                    <p>The featured link in a Google Plus post will pass page rank to the page to which it links. Note there is a no follow for links included in the body of a Google Plus post, you must use the featured link. If you connect a Google Plus page to your website this will increase the relevancy of your website content and support your search ranking                    </p>
                    <p>Links from regular websites to Google Plus content can also pass page rank authority in the other direction back to your Google Plus posts and pages.                    </p>
                    <p>The use of hashtags in Google Plus connects every post to a search on the platform.                    </p>

                  <img class="img-fluid d-block mx-auto" src="img/portfolio/stumble.png" alt="">
                  <h5>How to Use StumbleUpon for Business?!                  </h5>
                  <p>In today's world, any smart marketing campaign will include a mix of the various popular social media platforms. But it is important to remember that with any social media platform, in order to maximize the return, you need to be an active, regular participant in the community.One of the best and most visited social media websites you may wish to consider is StumbleUpon. StumbleUpon is a social media bookmarking site that allows users to "like" websites and add them to their profile. These websites are then shared with their friends through their profile and by using the "stumble" button, which is added to a user's browser toolbar when they sign up. The stumble button basically sends a user to a random website, usually one previously liked by a friend. StumbleUpon boasts more than 30 million users. Each user fills out a survey of their interests, so there is definitely the potential for your business website to reach a broad and targeted audience.</p>
                  <h5>What are the Benefits of StumbleUpon?                  </h5>
                  <p>StumbleUpon asks their users to define the categories that interest them, everything from action movies to zoology. If your business fits into one of these interest categories well, your site can get a lot of new visitors that are more likely to be interested in your business. Additionally, you are going to get a steady stream of visitors if you use it properly, as opposed to a burst of visitors from other paid advertising services that could potentially skew your website statistics or crash your servers.                  </p>
                  <h5>5 Tips to Increase Blog Traffic with StumbleUpon                  </h5>
                  <p>1. Don't Stumble Your Own Content                  </p>
                  <p>It is an unwritten rule of StumbleUpon that you should avoid stumbling your own content. Of course, that does not mean you can never submit your own content, but it is always better if someone else submits your content first. If you only stumble your own content, then other users won't feel you add any value to the StumbleUpon community aside from self-promotion. Essentially, if your content does well on other social networks, it stands a good shot at doing well on StumbleUpon also.                  </p>
                  <p>2. Stumble a Variety of Content from a Variety of Sources                  </p>
                  <p>Take the time to stumble content from a variety of blogs and websites as well as a mixture of articles, photos and videos. Only stumble the very best content that you truly want to share with other StumbleUpon users. Avoid stumbling content that does not add value to other StumbleUpon users.                  </p>
                  <p>3. Use Great Titles and Descriptions                  </p>
                  <p>When you stumble content, take the time to write a great title and description for that content to entice other users to click through and view your submission. Vague titles and descriptions are not helpful to other users.                  </p>
                  <p>4. Make Friends                  </p>
                  <p>Take some time to get to know other members of the StumbleUpon community and befriend them. Your StumbleUpon presence will grow as you network with more users. Do not just add a friend then forget about them. The power of StumbleUpon grows the more you network.                  </p>
                  <p>5. Use One Account and One Identity                  </p>
                  <p>Do not try to fool the StumbleUpon community by creating multiple accounts or stumbling only your friend's content and vice reverse. Chances are you will get caught, which could lead to your content getting buried or you getting banned from StumbleUpon temporarily or permanently. Follow the rules (even the unwritten rules)!!!                  </p>

                  <img class="img-fluid d-block mx-auto" src="img/portfolio/pintrest.jpg" alt="">
                  <h5>Another great way to promote your business is Pinterest! Increase your Serach Engine Rankings Now!                  </h5>
                  <p>Pinterest is the one of the fastest growing social networks online. It has well over 70 million users. Pinterest is a free website in which users can upload, save, sort and manage images, known as pins, and other media content (e.g. videos and gifs) through collections known as pinboards. Pinterest acts as a personalized media platform, whereby users content and the content of others can be browsed on the main page. Users can then save individual pins to one of their own boards using the "Pin It" button, with Pinboards typically organized by a central topic or theme. Users can personalize their experience with Pinterest by pinning items, creating boards, and interacting with other members. By doing so, the users "pin feed" will display unique, personalized results.                  </p>
                  <h5>Pinterest is social media's rising star — and now has the traffic stats to prove it.                  </h5>
                  <p>Pinterest also allows businesses to create pages aimed at promoting their businesses online. Such pages can serve as a "virtual storefront". In one case study of a fashion website, users visiting from Pinterest spent $180 compared with $85 spent from users coming from Facebook. These users spent less time on the company's website, choosing instead to browse from the company's pinboard. Further brand studies have continued to show Pinterest is more effective at driving sales than other forms of social media.                  </p>
                  <h5>12 Tips to Increase Your SEO with Pinterest:                  </h5>
                  <p>Do you want to establish authority in your field? This is a common goal for many businesses on Pinterest. Like the more established networks such as Facebook and Twitter, Pinterest allows companies and individuals to post, share and spread content of all types. As an SEO marketer there are huge gains to be made by turning to the Pinterest platform, as it offers many unique tools to boost SEO.                  </p>
                  <p>Like any social networking site the biggest draw for Pinterest in terms of marketing is the ability to share new content with the world. By creating a profile page you are free to share whatever images and captions you choose, thereby allowing other Pinterest users to view the content and "pin" things they like to their own profiles where even more people will see it. Whether you're posting product information, new blog posts or just images of the office, it is a great way to reach out to a massive audience and grow that viewership with very little input.                  </p>
                  <p>1: Expand Your Reach                  </p>
                  <p>Do you want to expand your reach and grow the size of your audience? Consider leveraging the community on Pinterest. Use Group Boards and collaborate with popular pinners who have a large following to expose your brand and content to more people. Your followers will see what your contributors pin, and what they pin will reflect on your business, so trust between parties is important. The collaborative partnership should benefit both parties. Collaborate with someone outside of your niche and your followers will be confused. The collaboration must make sense. With careful thought this is a great way to get in front of a wider audience.                  </p>
                  <p>2: Build Backlinks                  </p>
                  <p>In much the same way that Pinterest allows for exponentially growing viewership of content posted it also creates a huge amount of backlinking for your site. In SEO terms a backlink is an invaluable thing to have, as search engines create page rankings by taking into account how many outside links will lead people to your site. With proper usage Pinterest can create many of these useful links.

                    As a user you can insert links into the captions and information of your Pinterest posts. This means that every time someone "pins" or shares one of those posts a new backlink is created. It provides a new chance for someone to find your site and gives a boost to SEO rankings. Additionally, as your content gains exposure, it can also lead to viral links if people like the content and link to it from their own sites or social channels</p>
                  <p>3: Drive Traffic to Your Site                  </p>
                  <p>In order to take advantage of this, Pinterest users first have to be attracted to your pins and repin them to their boards. The most successful pins on Pinterest have some traits in common. They combine great images with content to solve a problem, inspire, offer something desirable or appeal to interest in a hobby or activity. Share attractive content on Pinterest to drive traffic to your site! Building a strong stable of owned media – Pinterest content, Facebook content, Twitter Content, YouTube content, blogs – in addition to your primary ecommerce site improves the likelihood that your brand will dominate more of the search results in a crisis.</p>
                  <p>4: Keyword Targeting                  </p>
                  <p>Another vitally important part of SEO with any website is keyword targeting. You must use the keywords frequently in your content that your target audience is searching for, thereby increasing your page rank when those keywords are searched.

                    You can work keyword targeting into Pinterest posts as well. Use those same keywords in the descriptions you're allowed to include with each post, along with a website link of course. This will bring your Pinterest page up in the rankings for those keywords as well, providing yet another way for people to find your content. And a higher ranking Pinterest page also increases the value of those backlinks, in turn boosting your SEO even further.</p>
                  <p>5: Optimizing Pinner Profiles                  </p>
                  <p>When signing up for a Pinterest profile, make sure to choose a "Pinner name" that will represent the brand well. The profile name will be used in the title tag and URL for the profile page, both of which will impact SEO for traditional search engines as well as Pinterest search. Complete the entire profile for maximum findability, including name and location keywords that may help in brand and location searches. Make sure to use keywords in the description as well, and include the URLs to your ecommerce site, Twitter, and Facebook.                  </p>
                  <p>6: Optimizing Boards                  </p>
                  <p>Based on the keyword research, define the content topics you'll create Boards around. Give each a meaningful, descriptive title that includes the keyword the Board will target. Make sure to categorize the Board correctly to help increase visibility in Pinterest search.                  </p>
                  <p>7: Optimizing Uploaded Pins                  </p>
                  <p>Pins should also be chosen based on keyword research. Since Pins are the default view in Pinterest search, ensuring that Pins are strongly aligned with the phrases that people search for is critical to earning a place in Pinterest search results. Optimize Pins with strong descriptions that use the targeted keyword, but remember Pins with shorter captions may be more likely to be Repinned. Include details like a link to the product and the price. Use a short, descriptive file name when saving the image, containing the targeted keyword if relevant.                  </p>
                  <p>8: Choosing the Visual                  </p>
                  <p>Searchers will judge Pins, Boards, and Pinner profiles by their visuals. Even if the optimization is perfect, without a correspondingly perfect image the Pin will fail. If the image doesn't excite the community, they won't Repin it or Like it and the Pin will not rank well.                  </p>
                  <p>9: Optimizing eCommerce Sites for Pinterest                  </p>
                  <p>To this point the optimization tips have been focused on content the brand itself posts on Pinterest. You can also optimize your eCommerce site to encourage more Pins and make Pins more effective. The most obvious step is to add Pinterest buttons or widgets to your product detail pages to make it easy for customers to Pin products to share with their friends. In addition, use Rich Pinsto automatically add details like pricing and availability when customers Pin your pages. Getting started with Rich Pins requires some development work to incorporate meta tags into your pages and an application process.                  </p>
                  <p>10: Use the "Pin It" Button                  </p>
                  <p>Pinterest is all about sharing content across the web so it's no surprise the site makes it easy to do that even from outside sources. As a Pinterest user you have the ability to add a special button to any post on your own website.

                    This "Pin It" button allows readers to automatically post an article or photo to their own Pinterest account to begin sharing with the world. It's a small but excellent way to get more mileage out of everything on your website even if you don't publish it to Pinterest yourself.</p>
                  <p>11: Build Followers                  </p>
                  <p>Just like a Twitter or Facebook account, users can follow specific Pinterest accounts they like. This notifies them whenever that account posts new content so that they can see it and share it quicker. Build up the followers for your Pinterest account and the content you share will spread further and faster, greatly increasing the SEO of the linked page. If someone follows you be sure to follow them back as well, because then you'll be recommended to other users and the followers base will continue to grow.  Be sure to engage with others on Pinterest by commenting on their pins and liking their pins, this will in turn encourage them to like you back.                  </p>

                    <p>Post your sounds to share them with friends, fans and followers everywhere. Connect with the community on SoundCloud to build your audience. SoundCloud is an online audio distribution platform that enables its users to upload, record, promote and share their originally-created sounds. It had 40 million registered users and 200 million listeners. Share your sounds!                      </p>
                    <p>With SoundCloud and Like4Like.org you can share your posts easily across social networks like Facebook, Twitter, Tumblr and Pinterest and increase your search engine rankings!                      </p>
                    <p>Follow other people and like and repost their music and audio, leave feedback in timed comments, join a group or start your own. The heart of SoundCloud is its deeply engaged community of creators who share the sounds they create with each another and the world. SoundCloud is not only about sharing sounds but also about sharing common interests, attitudes, goals and connecting with people who share your passion.                      </p>
                    <h5>How to Grow Your SoundCloud Community?!                      </h5>
                    <p>Listen closely to many sounds from many SoundClouders. This is the first and most important step in growing your own community: understand what is already out there and who is doing what. Use search tools and groups to find sounds you like.                      </p>
                    <p>Adding a track you like as a favorite goes a long way with people, who may just return the favor. Dropping a timed comment often starts a conversation, and following the person keeps you in the loop for future uploads                      </p>
                    <p>Make honest, relevant, useful, encouraging comments, often. It is ok to say "nice" but even better to say "nice drums, but sounds like some bass details are getting lost. It is not great to say "nice, listen to mine" if you did not actually listen to it – many perceive that as spam.                      </p>
                    <p>Reply to your comments and messages, connect with your listeners. A polite response to compliments on your tracks and in your inbox is generally appreciated by your listeners and keeps the conversation going (but keep point three in mind).                      </p>
                    <p>Join like-minded groups and share your sounds. Moderated groups are often better. It is a good way to get heard and also to hear more like yours. Moderated groups weed out the noise from tracks that are completely irrelevant to the group theme.                      </p>
                    <p>Start a group with your unique theme, hunt down relevant tracks to invite contributions. This is a great way to meet like-minded SoundClouders and to create a sound space of your own.                      </p>
                    <p>Thank your group contributors and let them know what you think of their sound with a timed comment. This is a great way to connect with like-minded creators, and build up your own community.                      </p>
                    <p>Share your favorite artists and tracks with your other social networks freely. It is great to get Tweeted or Facebooked by a follower who likes your track. Return the favor in advance.                      </p>
                    <p>Offer your own tracks for remixing and consider Creative Commons licensing. You might be surprised what unexpected variations and usages come back from the overall SoundCloud community of hugely diverse genres.                      </p>

                    <img class="img-fluid d-block mx-auto" src="img/portfolio/myspace.jpg" alt="">
                    <p>Once the champion of the social networking masses, MySpace has gone through many changes throughout its years as a social network. While MySpace is a great social network with a lot of bells and whistles, its pop culture roots limit its viability for many organizations.                      </p>
                    <p>MySpace is a social networking, combined with various other platforms and sub-sections - in this case video, comedy, celebrity, music, urban, schools (universities). It also offers apps, blogging, forums and friend-findings functions, as well as games, instant messaging and mobile content. Users create profile pages and design their own pages - from background, colors and fonts to soundtrack (you can embed a music-player on your page). They connect with each other and keep up-to-date with whichever sections of the site interest them.                      </p>
                    <h5>Who uses MySpace?                      </h5>
                    <ul>
                      <li>Users: approx 125 million per month, international                        </li>
                      <li>Age and industry: majority are late teens and early twenties. As such, most users 'careers' have yet to be defined, but music and fashion have by far the greatest presence                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <h5>Why would I want that?                      </h5>
                    <ul>
                      <li>Targeting people in their late teens and early twenties.                        </li>
                      <li>Positioning a brand or product as 'cool' (if you can do it right).                        </li>
                      <li>Viral spread of video or cult-status of a product among young people.                        </li>
                      <li>Researching youth trends.                        </li>
                      <li>Well suited to music and fashion businesses.                        </li>
                      <li>Opening up dialogue with young people.                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Businesses that primarily benefit from using MySpace include non-profits and charities, social awareness groups, social media groups, companies geared towards teens and college students, and fashion music companies. While there are likely other businesses that might also have a place on MySpace (such as advertising agencies or talent agencies), the crowd that MySpace generally draws is not the same crowd one would expect from Linkedin. As a technology trend, social networks and software are able to provide tools to companies seeking customizations on social networks such as MySpace, Twitter, Facebook and Linkedin.                      </p>
                    <p>Social Networking through MySpace for all business industries, does it works?                      </p>
                    <p>While MySpace is a great social network tool to promote organizations from multiple industries, it is not a right fit for many professional groups. The key concern with MySpace when used by businesses is that its origins are pop-culture-based and have a strong relationship to videos and music. While MySpace has a competitively populated user base and ever-improving tools and functionality, it is difficult to size up to social networks like Facebook that have origins based on college student and alumni-exclusivity.                      </p>
                    <p>MySpace has quite a few great modules that are geared toward individuals, but businesses can also implement their own modules. The music and entertainment industries are a shoe-in to use MySpace, but there are some stretches that would be relative to the business itself, such as information technology firms, advertising firms, educational institutions, etc.

                        Some of the features that MySpace provides the ability to include a link back to the company website and advertise events on the MySpace homepage calendar. There is also a high degree of customization possible using MySpace, which allows companies to create profiles that match with the look and feel of the official website.</p>
                    <h5>  Options to creating a company profile on MySpace                      </h5>
                    <p>Create a profile for the company head or someone who is similar to a spokesperson for the company (it could even be a company mascot of sorts). The only trick is ensuring a separation of the personal identity of the individual with the way in which they represent the organization through MySpace.                      </p>
                    <h5>How You Can Improve Your Page                      </h5>
                    <p>On Page Content                      </p>
                    <ul>
                      <li>Use most common keyword (movie title, band name, artist name) as the profile display name.                        </li>
                      <li>Try not to use Roman Numerals, long official names, or uncommon abbreviations. Use a common form that most people would type to search to find your site. For Example, 'Xmen 3' gets about 10 times more search traffic than ''X‐men The Last Stand'' and ''X‐men III'' combined.                        </li>
                      <li>Use plain text in profile, search engines cannot see text within an image, bios and descriptions must be in plain html text.                        </li>
                      <li>Try as much descriptive relevant text as possible on the profile, 400+ words is ideal, even more content is better.                        </li>
                      <li>Provide unique content. Do not use a stock promotional bio or description that is already placed on every other website. Personalize the profile content for MySpace.                        </li>
                      <li>Use other variations of the main keyword and related words within the profile content nicknames, acronyms, related words, common alternate names, actors, actresses, and musician names). Many users will search for these terms as well.                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Linking & Link Building                      </p>
                    <ul>
                      <li>Add an exclusive video, screenshot, or interview. If the MySpace page is the only source, manyother sites and blogs will create links to the profile. These links will not only provide natural traffic from clicks, the links will count as votes to help the MySpace profile rank in the search engines.                        </li>
                      <li>Link as much as possible to your MySpace profile/channel on your website(s) – this will improve relevance to your MySpace page in searches. Create html text links from the official site, partners, or fansites to your MySpace profile.                        </li>
                      <li>Do not use javascript, flash, or an image as the link.                        </li>
                      <li>Link to your vanity URL with the main keyword as anchor text.                        </li>
                      <li>In addition to ranking on its own, if you have other MySpace links on your page, ensure a higher ranking by using Like4Like.org. Your page gets credit for this link improving your organic search ranking.                        </li>
                      <li>Always link to your local country subdomain for any profile. This will help them rank in your local search engine, since they like to favour local content e.g. uk.myspace.com.                        </li>

                    </ul>
                    <p>What Not to Do                      </p>
                    <ul>
                      <li>Don't place all the content on the page in images or flash. Search engines use the text on a page to determine its relevance which directly results in high rankings. Search engines cannot read text that is in an image, flash, or javascript.                        </li>
                      <li>In order to rank for a keyword like 'music', this phrase must appear directly on the page, not in an image.                        </li>
                      <li>Don't link to the profile page with the generic link text like 'Click Here' or 'View More'.                        </li>
                      <li>Don't hide content using invisible text, tiny text or CSS tricks to create white text on a white background.                        </li>
                      <li>Don't stuff Keywords on the page. Adding 'XMEN XMEN XMEN XMEN XMEN XMEN' will not help your pages rank.                        </li>
                      <li>Don't spam blogs, forums or guestbook comments to obtain inbound links.                        </li>
                      <li>Don't buy links from 3rd parties that claim they boost traffic to your page.                        </li>
                    </ul>
