                  </p>
                  <p>Imagine that you are an owner of a store, which is located in a low key street, and you do not have any advertisement, marketing, logo or sign. You may have a brilliant product, but your potential buyers have no way of being aware of you.                    </p>
                  <p>It is similar on the internet. Quality and originality are certainly a plus, but people have to have a way of hearing about you. Today, one of the best ways for this is to have a strong internet presence, across a wide range of social networks. Create a Facebook profile, upload a Youtube video, twitter something or upload a photo to Instagram. You can think of each like, share and view as a form of virtual currency.                    </p>

You can influence on this in several ways: basic adjustments, advanced techniques, and paid advertising. Still, the most important thing is:                    </p>

                  <p>Meta tags                    </p>
                  <p>Firstly, there are meta tags, which Google recognizes as key phrases connected with your site. Meta tags are keywords, descriptions, and much more. So, for example, if you were in business of servicing air-conditioners, meta tags should relate to your area of expertise, services and special offers.                    </p>
                  <p>Description</p>
                  <p>Further more, a precise and clear description will go a long way of helping you – well used 160 characters can make a big difference. Recently, Google has started paying more attention to the general description over keywords, since they can be abused by constant repetition. This development was introduced in order to provide more relevant search results, by listing sites that are really connected to the searched phrase, instead of those that simply repeat the phrase infinitely. Google now pays attention to complete texts, themes and, so to say, a viable presence of key phrases and words.                    </p>
                  <p>Headlines and site maps                    </p>
                  <p>The latest development is that Google will emphasize which site is responsive, which means that it is adjusted for viewing on both mobile phones and tablet devices – but this does not mean that the site has to be mobile friendly in order to appear in search results, it just helps. Due to the extremely fast growth of usage of new and mobile devices for surfing the internet, Google ranks the sites that follow this trend higher than those that do not. If your site is not responsive, it does not mean that it cannot be viewed on a mobile device, but its functionality is limited – the site is either reduced, and zooming becomes necessary, or its size remains the same, and up-down and left-right scrolling becomes necessary to see the whole site. Responsive design introduces breaking points, places where, depending on the size of the device, the site ‘breaks’, in order to adapt more fully.                    </p>
                  <p>ALT tags                    </p>
                  <p>To summarize – optimize your website. Attractively designed, skillfully arranged, and optimized website will always achieve a higher ranking. Create a site map, and check your description and meta tags. Make your site mobile-friendly. Do not try to ‘trick’ Google, for you will be sanctioned for it. This means that you should not use fake descriptions, too many keywords, or keywords that put you in the results that are in no way connected with your business. These shortcuts can bring only short-term advantage, and long-term consequences.                    </p>
